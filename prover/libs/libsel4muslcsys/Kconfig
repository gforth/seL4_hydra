menuconfig LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS
    bool "Minimal muslc syscall"
    default y
    depends on LIB_SEL4 && LIB_MUSL_C && LIB_SEL4_UTILS && LIB_SEL4_VSPACE && LIB_CPIO
    help
        Minimal muslc syscall implementation for seL4.

config LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS_MORECORE_BYTES
    int "Malloc limit"
    default 1048576
    depends on LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS
    help
        This value sets the number of bytes reserved for the region malloc
        allocates from. Note that you won't actually be able to allocate this
        entire amount because there is some bookkeeping overhead. This area is
        allocated statically.

config LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS_DEBUG_HALT
    bool "Perform seL4_DebugHalt on _exit and _abort"
    default true
    depends on LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS
    help
        Controls whether or not a DebugHalt should be called to implement Exit
        style syscalls. This is useful if you have a single app and thread, but
        should be turned off if using multiple threads that may wish to exit
        independently of the whole system

config LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS_CPIO_FS
    bool "Implementation of a simple file system using CPIO archives"
    default false
    depends on LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS
    help
        If this is enabled open and read syscalls will attempt to use the cpio archive
        _cpio_archive. This implements a basic read only POSIX interface to that file system

config LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS_ARCH_PUTCHAR_WEAK
    bool "Make __arch_putchar a weak symbol"
    default n
    depends on LIB_SEL4_MUSLC_SYS
    help
        This allows you to override __arch_putchar in another library or your
	application.
